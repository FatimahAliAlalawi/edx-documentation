Options for Editing Text Components
********************************************

You can use two different editing interfaces to work with a Text component.

* :ref:`The Visual Editor`

  With the visual editor you create, edit, and format content in a word
  processing-like interface, without using HTML markup directly. With the
  visual editor, you can more easily format your content, and add links and
  images. 
  
  The visual editor includes an **HTML** option for you to review the
  HTML markup and make small formatting changes to your content. However, this
  HTML option does not provide the detailed control you can get with the raw
  HTML editor, nor does it support custom formatting or scripts.

  If you add a Text component and select **Text**, when you select **Edit**
  the visual editor opens by default.

* :ref:`The Raw HTML Editor`

  If you prefer to mark up your content directly with HTML markup, you can use
  the raw HTML editor. If you need to include custom formatting or scripts in
  your content, you must use the raw HTML editor.

  If you add a Text component and select **Raw HTML**, when you select
  **Edit** the raw HTML editor opens by default.

  There is no way to switch between the Visual Editor and the Raw HTML editor 
  once one is selected.

.. note::
    If you copy text from another source and paste it into either the visual or
    raw HTML editor, be sure to proofread the result carefully. Some
    applications automatically change quotation marks and apostrophes from the
    "straight" version to the "smart" or "curly" version. Both editors require
    "straight" quotation marks and apostrophes.

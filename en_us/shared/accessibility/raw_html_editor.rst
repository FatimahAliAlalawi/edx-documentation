The Raw HTML Editor
=========================

The raw HTML editor is a text editor. It does not offer a toolbar with
formatting options.

When you use this editor, you must supply valid HTML. The raw HTML editor does
not validate your HTML code. If you use this editor, you should thoroughly test
the HTML content in your course.

.. important::
 When you add a heading to a Text component, make sure that you use only
 heading level 2 ``<h2>`` through heading level 6 ``<h6>``. Text components are
 part of a complete page, and elements outside the Text component use heading
 level 1 by default. Because tools such as screen readers use heading
 levels to navigate through pages, using heading level 1 inside a Text
 component can interfere with the functionality of these tools.

Review HTML Markup in the Visual Editor
*****************************************

To review the HTML markup added to content in the visual editor, select
**HTML** from the visual editor's toolbar. The HTML source code editor opens.

You can edit text and the HTML markup in this editor. However, you cannot add
custom styles or scripts in this editor. To do this, you must use the
:ref:`raw HTML editor<The Raw HTML Editor>` instead.

Select **Save** to return to the visual editor. The visual editor attempts to
correct any problems with the markup that you entered. For example, if you do
not provide a close paragraph tag, the editor adds the tag for you.

You can then continue working in the visual editor.

.. warning::
 Selecting **OK** in the source code editor does not save your changes to the
 Text component. To save your changes and close the component, select **Save**
 in the visual editor. If you select **Cancel**, the changes you made in the
 HTML source code editor are discarded.

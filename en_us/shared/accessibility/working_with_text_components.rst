Text Component Overview
***********************

HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard markup language used to
create web pages. Web browsers present HTML code in a more readable format.

When students see text and images in your course, they are seeing HTML code
that is formatted and presented by their browsers. For more information about
HTML, see `Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML>`_.

===================
Text Components
===================

Text components are the basic building blocks of your course content. You use
Text components to add and format text, links, images, and more. You can work
with your Text components in a "visual" or WYSIWYG editor that hides the HTML
code details, or in a "raw" editor that requires you to mark up your content.

.. note::
 Review :ref:`Developing Your Course Index` and :ref:`Best Practices for HTML
 Markup` before you start working with Text components.
